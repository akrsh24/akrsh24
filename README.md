### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Akarsh Srivastava, from India. Currently working with Publicis Sapient on technologies like Javascript, React, Java , C++ , and etc etc. I am not an interesting person, and that's why you will find me with my laptop even in my free time. I like to build things from scratch, as it gives me flexibility to think and develop. Finally, after working for more than 2 years and switching between different languages , I found my interest in Frontend Engineering. May this love and interest prevail till eternity.

Currently, learning and building my profile in this domain. D mail me, if in anyway I could help or contribute in your project, career or maybe for any suggestions/advices and all also.
