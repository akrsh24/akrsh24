### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Akarsh Srivastava, from India. Currently working with Publicis Sapient on technologies like Javascript, React, Java, C++, etc. I may not be a fascinating person, and that's why you will find me with my laptop even in my free time. I like to build things from scratch, as it gives me the flexibility to think and develop. Finally, after working for more than two years and switching between different languages, I found my interest in Frontend Engineering. May this love and interest prevail till eternity.

Currently, learning and building my profile in this domain. You can mail me if in any way I could help or contribute to your project, career, or maybe for any suggestions/advice and all also.
